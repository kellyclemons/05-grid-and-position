              <p class="card-text">In the first assignment we created a working HTML site that required the use of both HTML and CSS syntax. The first obstacle that we had to overcome was using the terminal to create a new directory and commit it to GitHub. The next obstacle was debugging the CSS and HTML code that was given to us. While this activity was tedious at first, it got easier as we got a grasp on the patterns that were evident in the code. This activity proved to be very helpful and we eventually were able to make a site that was free of errors and looked like it could actually be on the web.</p>

              <p class="card-text">The second assignmentâ€™s mission was to recreate a site using HTML and CSS. To complete this requirement had to be able to group HTML elements and work with the layout of those elements in CSS. In doing so, we had to utilise a number of border box concepts to get an identical layout. Other concepts we had to navigate through were the double container pattern, specific grouping techniques, css floats, grids, and borders to name a few. Overall, this exercise helped to solidify concepts introduced that we learned  from the previous lesson and to help us become familiar with new methods of styling.</p>

              <p class="card-text">The third assignment required us to write HTML and CSS code to recreate a given layout. Key requirements covered in the assignment were the ability to use float style grids, overflow, and other display properties. Objectives to overcome included centring our content, using a double container and a grid, the separation of layout and comment styling and HTML as well as recreating the mockup to the best of our abilities. Again, this assignment helped to solidify past concepts as well as to let us play around with newer techniques.</p>

              <p class="card-text">In the fourth assignment we were asked to recreate a HUD using HTML and CSS. Key objectives of this assignment included the use of styling elements in CSS such as display, float, em, rem, vh, vw, position, and transform. This was one of the more challenging homework assignments we received that week and I definitely struggled with it. While this was a difficult project, it provided me the opportunity to use trial and error to better get a grasp on the concepts we had been introduced to earlier that day.</p>
